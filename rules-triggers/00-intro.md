# Using Rules & Triggers with OpenShift Cloud Functions

In this scenario, you will deploy a simple nodejs timestamp function on the OpenShift Cloud Functions FaaS platform.
You will then setup activation polling to show when the timestamp function is executed.  After that, you will 
create a Rule and a Trigger to demonstrate how to use those features.

**Currently, the setup of OpenWhisk takes up to 8 minutes.  This setup was started when you started this scenario.
It is recommended that you come back in 8 minutes to proceed with the first step in this scenario.  We expect to fix
this 8 minute delay soon**
